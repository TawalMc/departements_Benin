### DÃ©partements du BÃ©nin

It's a simple interactive website based on React and the town of Benin where user choose the right town for right county
between four (04) propositions. You have 2 minutes to response as many as possible.
You can play at this address [http://departements.herokuapp.com/](http://departements.herokuapp.com/).

#### Download and modify
It is an open source project so you can download it and modify it, but please don't forget to reference me. Follow these
steps.

#### Update
Nextly I think to rewrite it and change the design by using either Material UI or Ant Design. And also change the
